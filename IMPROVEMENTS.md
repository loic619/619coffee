# Improvement backlog

**Repo:** `loic619/619coffee` · **Opened:** 2026-09-02

> **What this is.** An idea bank, filled by the **619coffee — Improvement focus** routine,
> which runs twice a day and each time studies **one** part of the app in depth. Every
> session must leave exactly one concrete, evidenced proposal here. Shipping is not its
> job: the **619coffee — Actions fix queue** routine drains this list one pull request at
> a time, after it has cleared any open failure work in `ACTIONS_ISSUES.md`.
>
> More goes in than comes out, and that is the design. This is a ranked list to pick
> from, not a to-do list to finish. Prune it whenever you like — deleting a row is a
> legitimate answer.
>
> **Health problems do not belong here.** Anything broken goes in `ACTIONS_ISSUES.md`.
> This file is only for things that work but could be better.

## The rota

Which slot is running is decided by the date and time in **Asia/Saigon**: a run starting
before 12:00 is **AM**, at or after 12:00 is **PM**.

| Day | AM | PM |
|-----|----|----|
| **Monday** | Futures Exchange tab | News tab |
| **Tuesday** | Supply — next sub-tab in the cycle | Supply — the one after it |
| **Wednesday** | Demand — consumption | Macro tab |
| **Thursday** | Freight tab | COT tab |
| **Friday** | Map tab | UX (cross-cutting: any tab) |
| **Saturday** | Data Map — next topic in the cycle | Workflow efficiency: what worked, what can be improved |
| **Sunday** | Research: propose a new paper / question | Research: improve the oldest existing piece |

### Rotation state — update this every time you use it

**Supply sub-tabs** (Tuesday, two per week, ~6 weeks per full cycle, in page order):
`Brazil → Colombia → Honduras → Ethiopia → Vietnam → Indonesia → Uganda → Total → Fertilizers → ENSO → S&D → Origin →` back to Brazil.

- **Next up:** Brazil (AM), Colombia (PM)
- **Last covered:** — (cycle not yet started)

**Data Map topics** (Saturday AM, one per week, in order):
`workflow → data → UX → security →` back to workflow.

- **Next up:** workflow
- **Last covered:** —

**Research** (Sunday):
- **Newest piece:** — · **Oldest not yet revisited:** — (Sunday PM picks this one)

## Backlog

Ranked within each tab, best first. `[ ]` open · `[~]` partly done · `[x]` shipped · `[-]` dropped.

**Effort** is a rough read for the fixer: **S** ≈ one file, **M** ≈ a few files, **L** ≈ needs a decision from Loic first.

| ID | Status | Tab | The improvement, in plain language | Evidence it's worth doing | Where | Effort |
|----|--------|-----|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------|--------|
| — | | | *Empty. The first session fills this in.* | | | |

## Rules for the routine writing here

1. **One proposal per session.** Not two, not zero. If the obvious thing is already listed, go deeper into the same area rather than widening to another tab.
2. **It must be real.** Open the actual code and data for that tab; name the file and the change. A proposal you could have written without looking is not a result. If after genuine study the honest answer is that the area is in good shape, say so in the session summary and log the *smallest true* improvement you did find — never invent one to fill the slot.
3. **Plain language in the impact column.** Loic is not a developer: say what changes for the person using the page. Keep the technical detail in the other columns.
4. **Specific enough to implement.** Another agent must be able to act on it without redoing your investigation.
5. **Check for duplicates** before adding, and update the rotation state above so the next session knows where the cycle got to.
6. **Never delete or rewrite `[x]` or `[-]` rows.** This file is a record of what was considered, including what was rejected.
